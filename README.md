Using the Helmholtz equation to model the amplitude field of wireless propagation.

This code is inspired by the following blog entry of Jason Cole:
http://jasmcole.com/2014/08/25/helmhurts
that explains the idea and basically solves everything already. 

The code is adapted from Frédéric Testard (fredo-dedup)
https://gist.github.com/fredo-dedup

with some changes to speed up the operation, conversion to dB, and other things.
